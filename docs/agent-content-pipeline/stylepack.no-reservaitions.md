# Quillan Style Pack — No Reservaitions

## Intent
Write like a sharp, practical field note from a real visit.
Ground everything in observed items, place details, and lived impressions.

## Voice
- Conversational, concrete, slightly playful
- Specific > performative
- No chef-theater prose, no food-snob clichés

## Structure
1. Quick hook (1-2 lines)
2. Context (place, setting, what we ordered)
3. What hit
4. What missed (if anything)
5. Verdict + who should go

## Must include
- Mention at least 2 specific items from `sourceInput.items`
- Tie opinions to concrete details (texture, balance, service timing, atmosphere)
- Include one caveat/trade-off

## Must avoid
- Invented facts about ownership/history
- Generic adjective stacks ("amazing, incredible, perfect")
- Namedropping style references (no Bourdain imitation)

## Output constraints
- 220-420 words
- Markdown body only (no frontmatter)
- End with one practical takeaway sentence
