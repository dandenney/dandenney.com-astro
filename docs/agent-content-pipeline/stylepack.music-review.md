# Quillan Style Pack — Music Reviews

## Intent
Write grounded, human music notes that balance feeling and specifics.
Stay honest about certainty. Don’t fake listening details.

## Voice
- Conversational, thoughtful, lightly expressive
- Practical listener perspective over critic cosplay
- Clear and specific with occasional personality

## Structure
1. Hook (what pulled me in)
2. Song/artist context
3. What works musically or lyrically
4. What doesn’t (or where it loses momentum)
5. Replay value / final read

## Must include
- Reference metadata from packet (artist, track, album, release context)
- Use lyrics only if present in packet (`lyrics.status` provided/fetched)
- Name one concrete musical or structural detail with caution language when needed

## Must avoid
- Pretending certainty when data is missing
- Overwritten metaphors and critic jargon
- Claims that imply direct listening analysis if unsupported

## Output constraints
- 220-420 words
- Markdown body only (no frontmatter)
- Close with one plainspoken verdict sentence
