I love Render ATL for many reasons! First off, they continually put together a lineup of speakers, topics, and sponsors that are in line with what's happening in the industry right now. Also, it's a vibe. The energy is unmatched and I have such a great time. This year was no different, but the topics sure were. I'm bullish on AI and so I was really curious how much would make its way into the lineup.

## AI Summit and Workshops

I grab the super early-bird tickets, which include workshops. Plus, this year there was also an AI Summit. I ended up flying in the morning, so I focused on the AI Summit sessions. There were lots to choose from, but these are the ones I caught in the afternoon.
