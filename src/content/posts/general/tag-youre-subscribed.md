Email has been a large part of my web dev career. I learned to love building out [newsletters for Code School](https://reallygoodemails.com/school/what-makes-a-really-good-emails) and that led me to doing some conf talks and even creating a course! That may be one of the reasons I've valued them, but a very large part of it is the shift in social media for the web community. I now primarily rely on email newsletters for my industry news, sprinkling on some RSS and links from the seven apps I have to be part of to replace Twitter.

Buckle up, because I have a loooootttt of them. To be fair, I do not "read" all of these, I mostly skim them for things I'm interested in. I'm grouping them by category and I'll start with web dev ones since that's likely the community this will reach the most.

I promise I skim all of these each week. When life gets busy, I will claim bankruptcy and start fresh with inbox zero, but these are how I stay in the know.

## Web Development

- **[A11y Weekly](https://a11yweekly.com/issues/)**

  Since [Eric tagged me](https://ericwbailey.website/published/newsletters-that-regularly-hit-my-inbox-these-days/), I'll lead with one that I know is important to him as well. It's the best way I know to keep up with news around web accessibility

- **[Bytes.dev](https://bytes.dev/archives)**

  My most shared newsletter, where something in it will make me laugh out loud so I'll get it out on socials. It's one of the few I fully read, because it's both hilarious and informative

- **[Web Tools Weekly](https://webtoolsweekly.com)**

  Fantastic resource, with a weekly topic and one of the better collections of links to skim for your interests

- **[Frontend Focus](https://frontendfoc.us)**

  Another great one for skimming for your interests, usually with some descriptions that will make you crack a smile

- **[Sidebar](https://sidebar.io)**

  A community-driven newsletter that at one time I contributed to when Sacha was running it. It has a new sender, but the quality has remained

- **[The Pragmatic Engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com)**

  A little more "think-piece" than my others, this one has some article that you usually want to sit down with a coffee (or your smart article reading beverage of choice)

- **[Unicorn Club](https://unicornclub.dev)**

  A great mix of design, dev, and product links to skim

- **[Product for Engineers](https://newsletter.posthog.com)**

  The focus is what's on the tin and this one leans more towards longform articles since it's a substack

- **[JavaScript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com)**

  Another Cooperpress, I subscribe to most of what they do. They get the best collections of links related to a topic and they have for years. This one is about everyone's favorite thing to hate

- **[React Status](https://react.statuscode.com)**

  Another Cooperpress, for people who like their JS in the shadow realm. I heard React was good, so I check this out to see

- **[CSS Weekly](https://css-weekly.com)**

  Consistent quality links for skimming about everyone's favorite thing to debate on if it is a programming language

- **[Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/newsletter/)**

  Sure, this newsletter is about CSS, but it's really about the joy of Kevin's enthusiasm for anything. If he wrote about Angular, I'd probably still subscribe just to enjoy his passion

- **[Spark](https://codepen.io/spark)**

  Jaw dropping work, excellent resources, and usually nice, short read at the bottom. This one sparks joy in my life

- **[Smashing Newsletter](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter)**

  Smashing has been a consistent resource of mine for my entire web career, starting back in 2009. Their quality has been top-notch all the way through

- **[Modern Web Weekly](https://modernwebweekly.substack.com)**

  One of my newer finds, this one is "heady". You'll typically want time to read through some advanced breakdowns of front-end work

- **[TheoSoti](https://theosoti.com)**

  Another recent find, full of high quality tips for improving your code and finding ways to use the platform

- **[ModernCSS](https://moderncss.dev/newsletter)**

  I've been learning from Stephanie for years and her newsletters are a great way for you to as well

- **[Rendezvous with Cassidoo](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter)**

  A wonderful newsletter from the web's funniest dev. Short, human shares, great links, and a small challenge. (Plus, usually a joke)

- **[Ted's Newsletter](https://www.tedgoas.com/newsletter/)**

  A fellow email nerd turned Design Lead, I greatly enjoy his recaps. They're a mix of professional and personal shares and links

- **[Daily.Dev](https://daily.dev)**

  Community-driven collections of great links

- **[Hacker Newsletter](https://buttondown.com/hacker-newsletter)**

  Hot links from the best site to never read the comments section

- **[The Brief](https://designlab.com/blog-category/the-brief)**

  Quick collection of design-related links with thoughtful descriptions

- **[Byte Byte Go](https://blog.bytebytego.com/subscribe)**

  Dev articles that are typically over my head, but that I try to learn from anyways

- **[Lenny's Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com)**

  Recent sub, full of great articles leading to great videos, and some great links

- **[TLDR](https://tldr.tech)**

  This moves out of the front-end realm to more "tech" news, but it's another great collection of links to skim

- **[Drew Barontini](https://drewbarontini.com/newsletter/)**

  The most efficient front-end dev I've worked with and nowadays he puts a lot of that efficiency into product development

## Data Science

I work at DataCamp and have a penchant for data visualization. These help me feel the pulse of that world.

- **[Data Elixier](https://dataelixir.com)**

  Skimmable collection of links

- **[Data Science Weekly](https://datascienceweekly.substack.com)**

  Skimmable collection of links, with some interactive items

- **[The Median](https://dcthemedian.substack.com)**

  I know these folks! But seriously, I like this for the data science news and for what my teammates view as valuable 

## AI

You may want to skim over this if you're not into it, but I'm bullish on AI. 

- **[Ben's Bites](https://www.bensbites.com)**

  Commentary and great links 

- **[The Rundown](https://www.therundown.ai)**

  Nice grouping of links

- **[The Neuron](https://www.theneurondaily.com)**

  Love the visual style, great links to skim, and typically a nice prompt suggestion

- **[Neat Prompts](https://www.neatprompts.com)**

  Love the way these are grouped, makes it a very skimmable newsletter

- **[Last Week in AI](https://lastweekin.ai)**

  A little tough to skim than others because it's wordy and there's very little contrast between links and the long descriptions, but always good content

- **[Product Hunt Daily](https://www.producthunt.com/newsletters/archive/daily)**

  While technically a digital product collection, half of the list are AI-related things lately. I love skimming for interesting products I may want to try and to see what ideas are being built

## Nashville

I live in Nash and need to keep up with latest bars, restaurants, and things to do. Not expecting you to dig these, but maybe take it as a way to see if your area has some.

- **[City Cast Nashville](https://nashville.citycast.fm)**

  Great articles and podcast links for local stuff and a daily rundown of events and things to do. I've done so many thins from this.

- **[Nashville Scene](https://www.nashvillescene.com)**

  All things Nashville. News, politics, food, drinks, events, etc.
