Hill Country BBQ is a love letter to Texas, right in the heart of NYC. It’s where you go to experience the smoky, hearty flavors of true American barbecue, served with a side of Southern hospitality. For a team dinner with coworkers from around the world, it’s the perfect spot to share a quintessentially American culinary experience.

The Mayor Banquet Platter is a sight to behold, a feast fit for a celebration. It’s a carnivore’s dream, piled high with brisket, ribs, sausage, and chicken. The brisket is the star of the show, smoked low and slow until it’s melt-in-your-mouth tender, with a perfect bark and a deep, smoky flavor. The ribs are fall-off-the-bone delicious, coated in a tangy, slightly sweet barbecue sauce that’s finger-licking good. The sausage, with its robust, peppery kick, and the juicy, flavorful chicken round out the platter, offering a variety of textures and flavors that keep you coming back for more.

The sides are no less impressive. The campfire baked beans are smoky and sweet, with a hint of spice that lingers. They’re the perfect complement to the rich, smoky meats. The mac and cheese is pure comfort food, creamy and cheesy with a golden, crispy top that adds a delightful crunch. And the cornbread—oh, the cornbread. It’s moist, slightly sweet, and pairs perfectly with a pat of butter and a drizzle of honey. It’s the kind of side that makes you feel like you’re sitting at a family dinner table in the heart of Texas.

To wash it all down, a Brooklyn Lager. Its malty sweetness and slight bitterness make it a great match for the rich, smoky flavors of the barbecue. It’s refreshing and flavorful, cutting through the richness of the meat and enhancing the overall dining experience.

Sharing this meal with coworkers from around the world adds a special touch. It’s a chance to introduce them to the hearty, comforting flavors of American barbecue, and to bond over the shared joy of good food. The lively, welcoming atmosphere of Hill Country BBQ makes it easy to relax, laugh, and enjoy each other’s company.

Hill Country BBQ isn’t just a restaurant—it’s a sensory journey to the heart of Texas, a celebration of the rich, smoky traditions that make American barbecue legendary. It's a testament to the idea that the best meals are the ones that bring people together, creating moments of joy and connection over a shared table.
