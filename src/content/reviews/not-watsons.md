Not Watson’s Kitchen + Bar in Knoxville is a hidden gem that blends casual charm with culinary creativity. This downtown hotspot feels like the kind of place where you can kick back, let loose, and indulge in food that’s both comforting and exciting.

The Philly Egg Rolls are a revelation. Imagine all the best parts of a Philly cheesesteak—thinly sliced beef, gooey cheese, sautéed onions, and peppers—wrapped up in a crispy, golden shell. It’s a bite of pure decadence, the kind of appetizer that makes you wonder why anyone ever thought to serve cheesesteak any other way. These egg rolls are crunchy on the outside, bursting with savory, melty goodness on the inside. It’s an appetizer that demands your attention and earns it with every bite.

When it comes to main courses, the meatloaf here is a game-changer. Forget any preconceptions you have about meatloaf being mundane or boring. This version is elevated to gourmet status—rich, flavorful, and perfectly seasoned. Each slice is tender and juicy, topped with a savory gravy that’s the stuff of dreams. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables, it’s a dish that feels like a warm hug from an old friend, reminding you why comfort food became a staple in the first place.

A Tiny Bomb is the perfect partner for this meal. This American Pilsner from Wiseacre Brewing Company is light, crisp, and refreshingly straightforward. It’s the kind of beer that doesn’t overshadow the food but complements it beautifully. With its subtle floral hop notes and clean finish, Tiny Bomb is an ideal choice for washing down the rich flavors of meatloaf and the bold taste of Philly egg rolls.

Not Watson’s isn’t just about what’s on the plate—it’s about the entire experience. The atmosphere is lively, the service friendly, and the vibe just right for a night out. Whether you’re there to catch up with friends, unwind after a long day, or simply savor some seriously good food, Not Watson’s delivers. It’s a place where you can feel at home while still being surprised by what’s coming out of the kitchen, a testament to Knoxville’s growing culinary scene.
