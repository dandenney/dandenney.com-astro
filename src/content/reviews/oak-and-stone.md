At Oak & Stone in St. Petersburg, the atmosphere is as inviting as the menu—warm, lively, and just a little bit adventurous. The open, bustling space draws you in, but it’s the smell of wood-fired pizzas and the sight of the self-serve beer wall that keeps you excited about what’s to come. This is a place where comfort food gets a creative twist, and every sip and bite feels like it was made for savoring. 

The Philly steak egg rolls are everything you didn’t know you needed. Crispy on the outside, packed with tender steak, gooey cheese, and all the savory flavors of a classic Philly cheesesteak, they’re the kind of starter that disappears quickly. A little indulgent, a little nostalgic, and completely satisfying.

The Farmer & Pig pizza takes things up a notch. It's a masterpiece of flavors and textures, starting with a perfectly crisp, wood-fired crust. Topped with imported prosciutto, fresh arugula, and creamy mozzarella, it’s elevated by a drizzle of hot honey and herbed EVOO, adding a balance of sweetness and herbal depth. Finished with freshly shaved Pecorino Romano, each bite is a harmonious blend of savory, sweet, and slightly spicy that feels indulgent yet perfectly balanced.

And then there’s the beer wall—an entire row of self-serve taps showcasing a rotating selection of local and regional craft beers. It’s a beer lover’s dream, letting you sample everything from light lagers to hoppy IPAs and rich stouts. Grab a pint of something familiar or go on a tasting journey one ounce at a time.

Oak & Stone nails that perfect mix of comfort and creativity, giving you food and drinks that are as fun as they are delicious. Whether you’re there for the egg rolls, the pizza, or the sheer novelty of the beer wall, it’s a spot that knows how to make a meal feel like an experience.
