Hathorne, located in the heart of Nashville, is a place where culinary artistry meets a welcoming, communal atmosphere. It’s the kind of restaurant where you can savor expertly crafted dishes while enjoying the company of friends, both old and new.

The Tortelloni Cacio e Pepe is a standout dish that takes a classic Italian favorite and elevates it with precision and flair. The tortelloni are perfectly al dente, filled with a rich, creamy cheese mixture that melts in your mouth. The cacio e pepe sauce, a delicate blend of Pecorino Romano and cracked black pepper, clings to the pasta, creating a symphony of simple yet profound flavors.

Roasted Golden Beets offer a delightful contrast. They’re tender, earthy, and sweet, with a slight caramelization that enhances their natural flavors. Paired with a light dressing and perhaps a sprinkle of goat cheese or nuts, they provide a refreshing and healthy side dish.

The Grilled Carrots are another highlight. They’re charred to perfection, bringing out their inherent sweetness and adding a smoky depth. Seasoned simply with salt, pepper, and perhaps a hint of herbs, they’re both hearty and satisfying.

The Frites at Hathorne are not to be missed. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, they’re seasoned just right and served with a delicious aioli or ketchup. They’re the kind of side dish that complements any meal, adding a touch of indulgence to your dining experience.

To accompany this feast, a few glasses of Cab Sauvignon Martin Ray “Synthesis” 2020 are the perfect choice. This Cabernet Sauvignon offers rich notes of dark fruit, with a balanced acidity and smooth tannins that enhance the flavors of the meal. Its complexity and depth make it an ideal pairing for the rich, savory dishes at Hathorne.

Dining at Hathorne is more than just a meal; it’s an experience. The ambiance is warm and inviting, the service is attentive, and the food is crafted with passion and precision. It’s a place where every detail is considered, ensuring that each visit is memorable and satisfying. Whether you’re catching up with friends or celebrating a special occasion, Hathorne provides the perfect backdrop for a delightful evening out in Nashville.
