Max Lager's, nestled in downtown Atlanta, is a haven for those who appreciate the art of wood-fired grilling and craft brewing. It’s a place where the warmth of the wood-fired grill meets the robust flavors of expertly brewed beer, creating a culinary experience that’s both hearty and sophisticated.

Start your meal with the house salad. It’s a refreshing mix of crisp greens, juicy tomatoes, crunchy cucumbers, and other seasonal vegetables, all tossed in a light vinaigrette. It’s the perfect way to whet your appetite without overshadowing the main event.

The filet is a masterpiece of wood-fired perfection. Cooked to your liking, it’s tender and full of smoky flavor from the grill. The mashed potatoes are creamy and buttery, the ultimate comfort food companion to the steak. But the real star of the sides is the smoked collards. They add a Southern twist to the meal, with a rich, smoky depth that pairs beautifully with the tender, flavorful filet.

Pair your meal with a Max Black Porter. This beer is dark, rich, and complex, with notes of coffee and chocolate that enhance the flavors of the grilled steak. Its smooth, slightly bitter finish makes it a perfect match for the hearty meal.

For those who prefer a lighter beer, the Chant Lager is an excellent choice. It’s crisp and refreshing, with a clean, malty profile that complements the rich flavors of the food without overpowering them. It’s the kind of beer that enhances every bite, making the meal even more enjoyable.

Max Lager’s Wood-Fired Grill & Brewery isn’t just about the food and beer; it’s about the experience. The ambiance is warm and inviting, the service is friendly, and the attention to detail is evident in every dish and every pint. It’s a place where you can relax, enjoy great food and drink, and feel right at home.
