Redheaded Stranger in Nashville is a haven for bold, southwestern-inspired flavors served in a laid-back, no-fuss setting. With a menu that takes its tacos seriously and a burger that refuses to be overshadowed, it’s the kind of place where every bite feels like an adventure.

The first taco, a combination of crispy tater tots, jalapeño crema, red hatch chiles, and melted American cheese, is indulgence at its finest. The tots add a satisfying crunch, while the hatch chiles and crema bring a smoky heat that’s mellowed out by the gooey cheese. It’s a flavor-packed creation that turns every expectation of a taco on its head.

The chopped brisket taco is a smoky, tender masterpiece. Topped with melted American cheese and a drizzle of Dr Pepper hot sauce, it’s the perfect balance of sweet, tangy, and savory. Each bite is a blend of textures and flavors that keeps you reaching for more, the hot sauce adding just enough bite to cut through the richness.

The pulled pork taco brings a bright, fresh punch with sweet onion, cilantro, and jack cheese, tied together by a fiery jalapeño hot sauce. The pork is tender and flavorful, with the fresh onion and cilantro providing a crisp contrast that makes this taco a standout.

And then there’s the green chili cheeseburger. Juicy, perfectly cooked, and topped with a generous layer of green chiles and melted cheese, it’s everything you want in a burger and then some. The smoky heat from the chiles elevates the classic cheeseburger into something unforgettable.

Wash it all down with a cold Shiner Bock, a beer that’s malty and smooth, perfectly suited to handle the spice and richness of the meal.

Redheaded Stranger is a celebration of southwestern flavors, served with a little Nashville flair. From the inventive tacos to the unforgettable burger, it’s a place where bold, unapologetic dishes take center stage, leaving you full and ready to plan your next visit.
