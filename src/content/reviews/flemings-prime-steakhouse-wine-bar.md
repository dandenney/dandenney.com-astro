Fleming’s is one of those places where you know the check is going to be serious, so the food needs to earn it. This visit mostly did.

We started with the **ahi tuna poke stack**, and that was the right move. It was bright, clean, and gave the table a little contrast before the heavier plates came in. From there, we had two lanes running: steakhouse comfort and surf-and-turf excess. The **filet mignon** was cooked right and carried that soft, almost no-resistance texture you’re hoping for when you order filet. The **filet mignon and lobster tail** combo landed well too, especially if you’re in “treat yourself” mode and not pretending otherwise.

The sides did more than fill space. The **sweet corn brûlée** brought some sweetness without turning into dessert, and the **fleming potatoes** were exactly what you want in this setting: rich, salty, and built for sharing. Drink-wise, we bounced between **champagne**, **shiraz**, and a **guinness**, which sounds chaotic on paper but actually tracked with the meal pacing. Champagne up front kept things light, shiraz held up with the steak, and the Guinness worked as a reset.

If there’s a caveat, it’s this: this is not a subtle, low-cost weeknight stop. It’s a full-on steakhouse night, and you should order like you mean it.

If you go, start with the ahi tuna poke stack and commit to at least one strong side for the table.
