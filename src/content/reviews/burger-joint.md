Hidden behind a curtain in the swanky Parker New York hotel, Burger Joint feels like a well-kept secret. It’s a no-frills, no-pretensions kind of place, where the walls are covered in graffiti and the menu is straightforward. This is where you come when you want a damn good burger without the fuss.

The hamburger, ordered medium with the works and bacon, is a testament to simplicity done right. The patty is juicy, cooked to perfection with just the right amount of pink in the middle. The works—lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, and a smattering of special sauce—complement the beef without overpowering it. The bacon adds a smoky, salty crunch that elevates each bite. The bun, soft yet sturdy, holds it all together, absorbing the juices without falling apart.

A side of fries is mandatory here. They’re golden and crispy, with just the right amount of salt. Perfect for dunking in ketchup or eating by the handful, these fries are the ideal companion to the burger.

To wash it all down, a pitcher of Montauk. This beer, with its crisp and refreshing profile, pairs perfectly with the hearty burger and fries. It’s light enough to not overwhelm, yet flavorful enough to stand on its own.

Sharing this meal with coworkers from around the world adds another layer to the experience. It’s an introduction to American comfort food at its finest, a universal language spoken through the flavors and textures of a perfectly crafted burger. The laid-back, unpretentious atmosphere makes it easy to relax and enjoy good food and good company.

Burger Joint is a slice of Americana in the heart of NYC, a place where the simple things in life—good food, good beer, and good friends—come together in perfect harmony. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best experiences are the ones that bring us back to basics.
