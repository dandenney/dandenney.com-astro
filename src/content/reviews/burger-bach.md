Burger Bach is the kind of spot that takes the humble burger and turns it into something you’ll remember. The Wellington is no ordinary burger. It’s an unapologetic display of flavor—rich blue cheese, earthy mushrooms, all piled high on a perfectly juicy beef patty. The tang of the blue cheese cuts through the indulgence of the beef, while the mushrooms add that deep, savory note that keeps everything grounded. Paired with a Zombie Dust IPA, the bitterness of the hops slices through the richness of the burger, giving balance to each bite. It’s a bold pairing, and it works.

Then there's the Queenstown. This lamb burger is a thing of beauty—tender, sweet lamb, with the creamy goat cheese and cilantro creating this vibrant, bright flavor profile that lingers. Paired with a Guinness, the roasted, creamy stout contrasts beautifully with the freshness of the cilantro and the richness of the lamb, making the whole thing sing.

And those parmesan truffle fries? Crispy, fragrant, and indulgent, dusted with parmesan and kissed with just enough truffle oil to feel decadent without overdoing it. The fries bring the meal together, the perfect bite to share between sips of beer and the slow unraveling of flavors.

This isn’t just a burger joint—it’s where burgers go to be celebrated, each one carefully crafted and thoughtfully paired with the right beer. At Burger Bach, the attention to detail in every dish makes this a place you don’t just visit—you experience it.
