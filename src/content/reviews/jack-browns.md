Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint is the kind of place where comfort food reigns supreme, and the atmosphere is all about good vibes and great company. Sharing this spot with my love made it even better—a meal of indulgent, creative burgers, cold beer, and over-the-top desserts is a recipe for joy.

A Kentucky bourbon barrel cocoa porter sets the tone, its rich, chocolatey notes with a hint of bourbon making it the perfect pairing for the Cobra Kai burger. This burger is a flavor bomb with jalapeños, cream cheese, and a sweet and spicy pepper jelly that hits all the right notes. Paired with crispy fries, it’s indulgence done right.

The cream ale offers a lighter counterpoint, refreshing and smooth, ideal alongside the Dr. Gonzo burger. This one’s a hearty masterpiece, loaded with chili, cheddar cheese, onions, and a fried egg—messy, bold, and absolutely satisfying. Another round of fries completes the feast, perfect for soaking up all the rich flavors.

But the star of dessert is the deep-fried Oreos—four golden, crispy bites of pure bliss. The crunchy exterior gives way to the warm, melty cookie inside, a sweet treat that feels downright celebratory.

Jack Brown’s is a place that doesn’t overthink it. It’s about great burgers, cold beer, and a fun, laid-back vibe that makes you want to linger. Sharing it with my love made it even better—a memory carved out of indulgence, laughter, and just the right amount of messiness.
