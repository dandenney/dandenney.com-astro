Ruby Sunshine in Knoxville is a brunch lover’s paradise, combining Southern hospitality with a menu that is both comforting and inventive. The vibe is relaxed yet vibrant, making it a perfect spot for a leisurely brunch, especially if you’re sitting at the bar with a few mimosas.

The Pig Candy Bacon Bites are a delightful start to your meal. These little bites are a sweet and savory treat, featuring thick-cut bacon that’s been caramelized to perfection. The bacon is crispy yet tender, with a rich, smoky flavor that’s beautifully balanced by the sweetness of the caramelization. It’s the kind of appetizer that sets the tone for a decadent and satisfying brunch.

Moving on to the Eggs Blackstone “The O.G.”—this dish is a creative twist on the classic Eggs Benedict. It features perfectly poached eggs atop a base of crispy bacon and roasted tomatoes, all served on a toasted English muffin. The hollandaise sauce is rich and creamy, tying all the components together beautifully. Each bite is a harmonious blend of textures and flavors, from the runny yolk of the egg to the crunch of the bacon and the sweetness of the roasted tomatoes.

Sitting at the bar with multiple mimosas adds an extra layer of enjoyment to the experience. The mimosas at Ruby Sunshine are known for being fresh and vibrant, a perfect mix of champagne and orange juice that’s both refreshing and celebratory. The bar setting allows for casual conversation with the bartenders and fellow diners, adding to the lively and welcoming atmosphere.

Ruby Sunshine is more than just a brunch spot—it’s a place where you can relax, indulge, and enjoy the best of Southern-inspired breakfast and brunch dishes. Whether you’re catching up with friends or simply enjoying a leisurely morning, it’s a destination that promises delicious food and a memorable experience.
