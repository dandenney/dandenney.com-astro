East Nashville Beerfest 2025 had that perfect storm of good weather, weirdo energy, and beer-soaked joy that defines the neighborhood at its best. Sun shining, breeze cutting just enough heat, and the unmistakable smell of hops, melted cheese, and yuca fries wafting through the crowd. It was one of those days where everything hit just right.

The food trucks were doing god's work—crispy chicken and beef empanadas with golden, flaky crusts and fillings that punched with spice and depth. Yuca fries that were hot, starchy, and satisfying with a crackly outside that held up under any sauce abuse. And then the wild card: a pimento mac & cheese melt that felt like it was designed in a stoner's fever dream—melty, sharp cheese, creamy mac, smashed between grilled bread, unapologetically decadent and absolutely necessary.

Beer tasting was the main event, of course. Pours from the local heavyweights and some upstart brewers pushing boundaries—sours, lagers, barrel-aged madness, and everything in between. But the scene-stealer? The growing wave of THC-infused drinks. Crisp lemonades, herbal spritzers, even a hopped cannabis soda that felt like drinking a West Coast IPA after a hike and a joint. It was a mellow shift in the buzz, and the crowd leaned into it.

Live rock from the 80s and 90s blasted from the stage—big, swaggering riffs, a few surprisingly tight covers, and enough nostalgia to keep the vibes high. And because this is East Nashville, there was also live wrestling—ropes, bodyslams, absurd costumes, and a crowd that was way too into it in the best way possible.

It wasn't just a beer festival. It was a celebration of the weird, the local, the flavorful, and the slightly unhinged—in other words, everything East Nashville does best. One for the books.
