Tucked inside the JW Marriott, Trattoria Il Mulino feels like a quiet escape from the city’s buzz—dim lighting, soft clinks of glassware, and just enough of that old-world charm to make the night feel cinematic. It was our anniversary, and the place delivered exactly what you hope for when you want to mark time with someone you love: something elegant, something indulgent, something that lingers.

We started with an Aperol Spritz, bright and bracing, the color of celebration. The burrata and watermelon followed—creamy and cold, with that sweet-salty hit that wakes up the palate and slows everything down in the right way.

Then came the pastas. Goat cheese ravioli, soft and tangy, with a sauce that felt like it had been simmering just for us. And the gnocchi Bolognese—pillowy, rich, unapologetically comforting, the kind of dish you don’t talk over because it deserves your full attention.

We sipped our way through a few generous glasses of Super Tuscan, deep and velvety, each pour better than the last. There’s something about good wine with someone you know well—it turns conversation into a rhythm, not a task.

Dessert wasn’t a question. Cherry cheesecake and chocolate torta, one light and playful, the other dark and rich, like a closing track that ties the whole album together.

It wasn’t just a meal—it was a bookmark in our story. A night that tasted like where we’ve been and hinted at where we’re headed. Trattoria Il Mulino didn’t try to steal the show. It let us have our moment, and gave it just enough grace to feel unforgettable.
