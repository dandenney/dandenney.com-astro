Kantipur Cafe is the kind of place that invites you to slow down and savor the richness of Nepali and Indian flavors, blending warmth and tradition in every dish. It’s cozy, unassuming, and filled with the aromas of spices that feel both comforting and exciting.

A mango lassi starts things off, creamy and sweet with a refreshing tang that cuts through the richness of the meal to come. It’s not just a drink; it’s a palate cleanser and dessert all in one, perfectly setting the stage.

The chicken korma arrives next, tender pieces of chicken in a silky, spiced coconut and cream-based sauce. It’s fragrant, mildly spiced, and indulgently rich, a dish that wraps you in a blanket of warmth with every bite.

The chicken makhani follows, a classic that never disappoints. Known as butter chicken, it features succulent chicken in a tomato-based sauce with just the right amount of cream and spice. The makhani sauce is vibrant and layered, balancing sweetness and heat in a way that keeps you coming back for more.

The onion kulcha ties everything together, its slightly charred, crisp exterior giving way to a soft, pillowy interior filled with sweet, caramelized onions. It’s the perfect vessel for soaking up every drop of the korma and makhani, ensuring not a bite of the meal is left behind.

Kantipur Cafe isn’t just about the food—it’s about the feeling. Each dish tells a story of tradition and care, leaving you not just satisfied but connected to the flavors and culture that make it so special. It’s a dining experience that lingers long after the last bite.
