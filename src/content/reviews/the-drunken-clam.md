Spending Christmas dinner at The Drunken Clam in St. Pete Beach feels exactly right when the usual traditions just don’t seem to fit. The place hums with a laid-back, beach-town vibe, a mix of locals and travelers who’ve traded holiday formality for cold beers, good food, and the easy warmth of a coastal dive bar.

The Philly steak, piled high with tender, seasoned beef and melted cheese, is pure comfort food, especially paired with a basket of crispy tater tots that hit all the nostalgic notes. The Smashburger is no afterthought either—juicy, perfectly griddled, and loaded with all the fixings. The Cajun Parmesan Garlic wings bring the spice and the indulgence, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and coated in a sauce that walks the line between heat and richness with precision.

To drink, a mix of Reef Donkeys and PBRs keeps things refreshingly simple. The Reef Donkeys bring a crisp, citrusy edge, while the PBRs provide the kind of straightforward, no-nonsense beer that feels perfectly suited for a night like this.

Christmas at The Drunken Clam isn’t about candlelit dinners or carols—it’s about good food, cold drinks, and a shared sense of celebration that doesn’t need much more than the hum of conversation and the clink of bottles. It’s untraditional in the best way, the kind of holiday meal you remember for all the right reasons.
