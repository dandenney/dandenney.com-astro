At Answer, dining is an exercise in refinement without pretension. A few glasses of Piattelli Malbec from Mendoza, 2019, set the stage for the evening—rich, bold, and full of deep red fruit flavors with a touch of spice. It's the kind of wine that complements the nuances of the meal while standing strong on its own.

The asparagus with tempura and black sesame is a light and elegant starter. The crispness of the tempura gives way to the tender asparagus inside, while the black sesame adds a slight nutty, earthy note that lingers on the palate. It’s a dish that feels indulgent but balanced, setting you up perfectly for what’s next.

Then comes the 8oz filet. Perfectly cooked, this cut is tender and flavorful, enhanced by the light touch of lemon herb oil, which adds brightness without overpowering the richness of the meat. The roasted asparagus on the side mirrors the earlier dish but with a simpler preparation, letting the natural flavors shine through. The star side, though, is the hasselback potato—crispy edges, soft interior, with a presentation that’s both visually striking and deeply satisfying to eat.

At Answer, the food is thoughtful and deliberate, with each dish balancing flavor, texture, and presentation in a way that feels both elevated and accessible. It's the kind of place where a great meal comes together seamlessly, glass of Malbec in hand.
