Mike’s Pastry in Boston’s North End is a landmark, the kind of place that practically demands a stop whether you’re a local or just passing through. The line spilling out onto the cobblestone streets is a sign that what’s waiting inside is worth every minute.

The Boston creme donut is a triumph of simplicity. A pillowy-soft donut filled with rich, creamy custard and topped with a glossy chocolate glaze, it’s everything you want from this classic treat. Each bite is indulgent without being too heavy, a perfect balance of sweetness and texture.

Then there’s the chocolate-covered cannoli, a signature that’s as decadent as it sounds. The crisp shell crackles with each bite, giving way to a sweet, velvety ricotta filling. The chocolate coating adds an extra layer of richness, making it almost impossible to stop at just one.

For something lighter, the almond and coconut macaroons hit the spot. Perfectly chewy with a slight crunch at the edges, they’re packed with flavor and just the right amount of sweetness. The almond brings a nutty depth, while the coconut offers a tropical hint that feels like a little vacation in every bite.

Mike’s Pastry isn’t just a bakery; it’s an institution. Whether you’re there for a Boston creme donut or their legendary cannoli, the experience is as iconic as the treats themselves. It’s Boston in dessert form, unforgettable and utterly satisfying.
