New Year’s Day at Skull’s Rainbow Room is a celebration of indulgence, tradition, and the kind of timeless charm that Nashville does best. The soft glow of the lighting, the hum of conversation, and the unmistakable energy of a space steeped in history set the perfect tone for the first meal of the year.

A bottle of Malbec starts things off, its dark fruit notes and velvety tannins bringing a richness that feels celebratory. It’s the kind of wine that encourages you to linger, to take in the moment with the people who matter most.

The charcuterie board arrives, a beautifully arranged spread of cured meats, cheeses, and pickled accompaniments. Each bite is a perfect balance of salty, creamy, and tangy, a prelude to the decadence that follows.

The prime rib is a showstopper—thick, juicy, and perfectly cooked. The crust is deeply seasoned, giving way to a tender, flavorful interior that feels like a proper indulgence for the occasion. Paired with truffle mashed potatoes, luxuriously creamy with just enough earthiness from the truffle, the meal reaches a level of refinement that Skull’s is known for.

The bacon Brussels sprouts bring a smoky, crispy counterpoint to the richness of the meat and potatoes, their caramelized edges adding a touch of sweetness that rounds out the plate.

Skull’s Rainbow Room doesn’t just serve food; it creates an atmosphere. Surrounded by my love and close friends, sharing incredible dishes and a bottle of wine, it’s the kind of experience that makes New Year’s Day feel like a proper celebration. It’s not just about starting the year—it’s about savoring it from the very first bite.
