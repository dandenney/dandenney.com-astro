Degthai is the kind of hidden gem that makes you wonder why you didn’t find it sooner. A small, unassuming spot where the food is made fresh, the heat levels are serious, and the flavors are the kind of bold that linger long after the meal is over.

A Thai iced tea is the perfect start—cold, creamy, and sweet with that signature earthy note from the tea. It’s refreshing enough to prepare you for the heat that’s coming.

Jay’s Special, ordered hot, is not for the faint of heart. The spice level hits immediately, but underneath the heat is a rich, layered balance of umami and sweetness. Perfectly cooked noodles and tender meat soak up the sauce, delivering a punch of flavor in every bite. It’s the kind of dish that leaves your mouth tingling but makes you go back for more.

Pad Thai, also ordered hot, brings a different kind of heat. The balance of sweet, savory, and spicy is spot on, with chewy noodles coated in a glossy tamarind-based sauce. The crunch of peanuts and fresh lime give it that extra texture and brightness that keeps the dish from feeling heavy.

Degthai isn’t about frills or fancy presentation—it’s about delivering bold, unapologetic Thai flavors that stick with you. Sitting there with my partner, sweating through the heat, sipping on a Thai iced tea to cool down between bites—it’s exactly what you want from a Thai spot. No shortcuts, no compromises, just damn good food.
