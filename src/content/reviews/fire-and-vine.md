Fire & Vine has that easy kind of charm that comes from knowing exactly what it’s good at—simple, wood-fired pizza and wine poured without fuss. The space glows warm in the evening light, the hum of the oven blending with low conversation and the faint clink of glassware. It’s not trying to be a scene. It’s just comfortable, familiar, and quietly confident.

The hot honey pepperoni pizza came out blistered and beautiful, the crust crisp at the edges and soft in the middle. The pepperoni curled just right, little pools of rendered fat catching the drizzle of honey until each bite landed perfectly—spicy, sweet, and salty in one hit. It’s the kind of pizza that doesn’t beg for attention; it earns it.

A few glasses of Malbec rounded everything out—dark fruit, smoke, and enough backbone to stand up to the heat of the pie. And plenty of water, because some nights you need a little balance.

Fire & Vine feels like a place that doesn’t care about impressing you—it just wants you fed, happy, and lingering a little too long over your glass. In a world full of noise, that’s its own kind of luxury.
