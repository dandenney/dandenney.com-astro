O’Keefe’s is the kind of bar that nails the essentials: cold pints, hearty food, and an atmosphere that makes you want to stick around. It’s unpretentious but polished, the kind of place where the classics shine and comfort food gets a little extra love.

A pint of Guinness feels like a no-brainer here. Smooth, creamy, and poured just right, it’s the kind of beer that sets the tone for the meal—a little indulgent, a little grounding, and perfect for sipping as the pub hums around you.

The Reuben is exactly what you hope it will be. Thick slices of corned beef, tangy sauerkraut, melty Swiss, and just the right amount of thousand island dressing are sandwiched between perfectly grilled rye bread. It’s rich and satisfying, the kind of sandwich that demands your full attention.

And then there’s the truffle mac and cheese. Decadent without going overboard, the pasta is coated in a creamy, cheesy sauce with just enough truffle to elevate it. It’s comfort food made elegant, the kind of side dish that quickly becomes the main attraction.

At O’Keefe’s, the food and drink are straightforward yet elevated, served with a side of warmth and familiarity that makes the place feel like home—even if it’s your first visit. It’s a spot where the Guinness flows, the Reuben satisfies, and the truffle mac and cheese makes you wonder why you ever settled for the boxed stuff.
