Grendel’s Den in Cambridge isn’t just a pub—it’s a piece of history, a place that fought for the right to exist and won. Its name alone evokes myth and legend, but the real story lies in its landmark legal battle in the 1980s, where the bar defended its right to serve alcohol against the church next door, ultimately making its case all the way to the Supreme Court. That fight, rooted in the First Amendment, paved the way for a small business to thrive and left a legacy that’s as integral to its identity as its menu.

A pint of Exhibit A’s Sunday Paper feels like the perfect toast to that legacy. Smooth, balanced, and a little toasty, it’s a beer that invites you to linger and reflect. With its subtle hop bitterness and malty warmth, it’s the kind of drink that pairs perfectly with Grendel’s laid-back yet storied atmosphere.

Sitting here, you can’t help but feel the weight of the place’s history—not just in its fight for existence but in the way it’s become a cornerstone of the Harvard Square community. Grendel’s Den honors that history with every pint poured and every meal served, offering a space where locals and visitors alike can soak in the ambiance of a bar that stands for something more than just great food and drink. It’s a place where every sip carries a little bit of Cambridge’s rebellious spirit.
