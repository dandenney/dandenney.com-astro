PDQ in Pinellas Park is fast food that doesn’t feel like fast food. It’s quick, yes—but there’s a level of freshness and care in the food that makes you feel like someone actually gave a damn when they made it. Sitting down with a tray of fried goodness and a cold Cheerwine just hits differently after a long day.

The hot tenders are exactly what you want them to be—crispy, juicy, and coated in a sauce that brings a slow, lingering heat without overpowering the flavor of the chicken. The waffle fries are the ideal sidekick—golden, crisp on the edges, and soft in the center, perfect for dipping or just inhaling between bites of chicken. Washed down with a Cheerwine—cold, sweet, and full of that cherry fizz—it’s comfort food at its peak.

My partner went for the Nashville hot sandwich, which delivered the kind of heat that creeps up on you. The chicken is fried to perfection, crunchy on the outside and tender inside, with the Nashville-style heat cutting through the richness. The pickles and slaw give it a nice crunch and tangy contrast, balancing the spice just enough to keep you reaching for more. Another Cheerwine on the side ties it all together—a hit of sweetness to cool things down without losing the heat.

PDQ nails that sweet spot between fast and flavorful. The hot tenders, the sandwich, the fries, the Cheerwine—it’s a meal that satisfies the craving for something fried and spicy while leaving you wondering why all fast food can’t be this good.
