Tucked inside Bearded Iris like a well-kept secret, Black Dynasty doesn’t posture—it just delivers. No kitschy lanterns or overplayed Tokyo street art. Just dark wood, heavy steam, and the low hum of people who know exactly why they’re here.

We started with pork gyoza, crisped to the edge of char, filled with juicy, fatty pork that punched above its weight. A small bite, but a clear sign—these folks aren't messing around.

The garlic style miso tonkotsu came out first, thick with intent. Broth so rich it could mortgage a house, swirling with roasted garlic funk and silky noodles that held onto it like it was gospel. I paired it with an Aperol spritz, just to throw off the rhythm—a little bitter sparkle against all that umami heft.

Then came the hellfire—miso tonkotsu that doesn’t ask if you like spice, it just leans in and kisses you full on the mouth with it. Balanced heat though, not showboating. A couple Homestyles from the brewery side helped cool things off—hazy, juicy, familiar. Like a friend who shows up right when the fire starts creeping in.

Ramen, beer, and sweat on the brow. A meal that doesn’t try to impress—it just does.
