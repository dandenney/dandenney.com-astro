Often known as Butter Chicken, this dish is a lavish concoction of tender chicken pieces simmered in a creamy tomato sauce, rich with spices and a hint of sweetness. The sauce, velvety and aromatic, is a testament to the art of balancing flavors – a skill that Indian cuisine masters like no other. Every bite is a dive into the depths of culinary complexity, a journey through layers of flavor that culminate in a satisfying richness.
