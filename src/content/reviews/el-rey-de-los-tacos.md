When you're craving authentic Mexican flavors in the heart of Madrid, El Rey de los Tacos delivers in a way that makes you forget you're across the Atlantic. The unassuming spot may be casual, but the food packs a punch.

Starting with two carnitas tacos, you immediately get the sense that this place doesn’t mess around. The slow-cooked pork is tender and full of flavor, melting in your mouth with each bite. It’s got just the right amount of fat to make it rich without being overwhelming, the kind of taco that reminds you why carnitas are a Mexican staple.

Then there’s the cochinita pibil. These two tacos are a bit of a showstopper—marinated pork with that unmistakable citrus and achiote blend, slow-cooked until it falls apart. The flavors are bold and tangy, with a touch of spice that wakes up your palate. Each bite takes you a little deeper into Yucatán, where this dish hails from.

The tinga de pollo tacos bring a different kind of heat. Shredded chicken in a smoky chipotle sauce, balanced with just enough sweetness from the tomatoes. It’s the kind of taco where the flavors build up, leaving a lingering warmth that’s satisfying but not overpowering.

A glass of limonade ties it all together—refreshing and tart, the perfect contrast to the richness of the tacos. It cleanses your palate and keeps things light, making sure you’re ready for the next bite.

At El Rey de los Tacos, it’s not just about filling up; it’s about savoring the different layers of flavor in each bite. Whether you’re new to Mexican cuisine or a seasoned fan, this spot brings the kind of authenticity that’s hard to come by in Madrid.
