Basement is the kind of place that makes you feel like you’ve discovered one of New York’s best-kept secrets. Located at 45 Mott Street, this speakeasy-style bar is hidden behind a bright red Coca-Cola vending machine door, adding a playful touch of mystery to your night out.

Descending into the bar, you’re greeted by a dimly lit, minimalist space inspired by Hong Kong game bars. The atmosphere is both cozy and vibrant, with a range of games like beer pong, darts, dice, and cards adding to the fun. It’s a place where you can let loose and enjoy a laid-back evening with friends, all while sipping on expertly crafted drinks.

Speaking of drinks, the selection here is top-notch. Their menu features a variety of signature and seasonal craft cocktails, each with unique twists. But if you’re in the mood for a good beer, you can’t go wrong with a Brooklyn Lager. This local favorite, with its crisp and slightly malty profile, pairs perfectly with the lively and eclectic vibe of basement​.

Whether you’re catching up with friends or making new ones, Basement Chinatown offers a unique, fun-filled experience that’s quintessentially New York. It’s a subterranean retreat where the drinks are cold, the games are plenty, and the vibes are always chill.
