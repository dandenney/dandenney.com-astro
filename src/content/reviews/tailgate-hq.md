TailGate HQ on a beautiful day is about as close to perfect as it gets. Sitting at the outdoor tables, with the sun shining and a gentle breeze cutting through the Tennessee warmth, you get that feeling that all is right with the world. The hum of conversation and clink of glasses create the kind of laid-back, easygoing vibe that pairs perfectly with good beer and pizza.

A peanut butter stout is the kind of beer that sounds almost wrong until you take the first sip. Smooth, rich, and full of deep roasted malt flavors with a subtle hit of peanut butter at the finish, it’s indulgent without being overwhelming—a dessert beer you could happily sip all afternoon. The cream ale, by contrast, is light and refreshing with a slightly sweet finish that cleanses the palate and keeps things balanced.

The hot honey pizza brings everything together. Sweet and spicy with a thin, crispy crust, it’s topped with gooey cheese, salty pepperoni, and just enough hot honey to give it a slow burn that keeps building. The honey caramelizes slightly under the heat, adding a subtle depth that takes each bite to another level. The mix of heat, salt, and sweetness hits just right, especially when chased with a sip of stout or ale.

TailGate HQ nails the essentials—great beer, great pizza, and an outdoor setup that makes you want to linger long after the food is gone. It’s the kind of place where you lose track of time, sitting in the sun with a beer in hand and thinking, Yeah, this is exactly where I’m supposed to be.
