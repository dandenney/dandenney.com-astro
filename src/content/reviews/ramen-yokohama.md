After a long day of wandering Madrid’s streets, Ramen Yokohama offers a comforting refuge, where the flavors transport you to Japan despite being firmly in the heart of Spain. The Tan Tan Men here is a rich, soul-warming bowl of ramen. The broth is deep, complex, with just the right amount of spice and nuttiness from the sesame. The minced pork adds that satisfying, hearty element, while the noodles are perfectly chewy, soaking up the broth and carrying each bite with flavor. It's a dish that hits all the right notes, warming and filling without overwhelming.

Paired with an ice-cold Sapporo, the crisp, clean taste of the beer provides the perfect contrast to the richness of the ramen. The lightness of the Sapporo helps balance out the bold flavors of the Tan Tan Men, cutting through the spice and leaving you refreshed between bites.

Ramen Yokohama brings together the best of both worlds—traditional Japanese comfort food in the vibrant city of Madrid. Whether you’re a ramen aficionado or just in need of something nourishing after a long day, it’s a spot where you can relax, sip your beer, and let the warmth of the ramen wrap around you like a blanket.
