Blackhorse Pub & Brewery in Alcoa is a quintessential local hangout, known for its hearty fare and excellent house-brewed beers. The ambiance is inviting, the kind of place where you can settle in for an evening with friends, enjoy some great food, and sip on a cold brew.

Start with the Boo Radley sandwich. This isn’t your average sandwich; it’s a symphony of flavors and textures. Picture this: smoked turkey that’s juicy and flavorful, paired with Monterey Jack cheese for a creamy, slightly tangy bite. Add sautéed red onions for a touch of sweetness, crispy bacon for that perfect salty crunch, and a mix of spicy brown mustard and mayo to bring it all together. Lettuce and tomato add a fresh, crisp element, all served on toasted wheatberry bread that’s hearty and wholesome. It’s a sandwich that’s both comforting and satisfying, hitting all the right notes.

A side of fries accompanies this masterpiece, and they’re everything you want in a pub fry—crispy, golden, and seasoned to perfection. They provide the perfect crunch to complement the soft and savory sandwich.

To drink, a couple of Blackhorse Blondes are a perfect match. This blonde ale is light, refreshing, and slightly hoppy, making it the ideal companion for the rich flavors of the Boo Radley sandwich. It’s easy to drink and has a clean finish, perfect for a relaxing meal.

Before you leave, make sure to grab an Italian Flatbread to go. This flatbread is a delightful blend of Italian flavors, with a crispy crust topped with marinara, mozzarella, fresh basil, and pepperoni. It’s a great choice for a snack later, whether you’re continuing the evening at home or looking for a tasty lunch the next day.

Blackhorse Pub & Brewery is more than just a place to eat and drink; it’s a community hub where the food is crafted with care and the beers are brewed with passion. The friendly atmosphere and attentive service make it a must-visit spot in Alcoa. Whether you’re a local or just passing through, Blackhorse offers a taste of Tennessee hospitality that’s hard to beat.
