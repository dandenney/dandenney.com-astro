Present Tense in Nashville offers a dining experience that seamlessly blends Japanese flavors with contemporary culinary artistry. The minimalist, inviting ambiance sets the stage for a meal that is both refined and innovative.

Start with a Sapporo on draft. This Japanese lager is light, crisp, and refreshingly straightforward, providing the perfect palate cleanser to kick off your dining experience. Its clean finish and subtle hoppiness make it an ideal pairing for the rich and complex flavors of the dishes to come.

The Japanese sweet potato with miso butter and bonito is a revelation. The sweet potato is roasted to perfection, highlighting its natural sweetness and creamy texture. The miso butter adds a layer of rich umami, while the bonito flakes bring a smoky, slightly briny note that elevates the dish. Each bite is a delightful combination of sweet, savory, and umami flavors, making it a memorable start to the meal.

For the main course, the Iberico pork katsu is a standout. This dish features tender, flavorful Iberico pork, breaded and fried to a perfect crisp. The white verjus provides a delicate acidity that cuts through the richness of the pork, while the capers and endives add a refreshing crunch and a hint of bitterness. The result is a sophisticated take on katsu that showcases high-quality ingredients and expert execution.

Present Tense is more than just a meal; it’s a culinary journey that engages all the senses. Whether you’re a Nashville local or a visitor, dining here promises a memorable and delightful experience.
