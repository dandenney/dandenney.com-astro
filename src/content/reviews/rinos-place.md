Rino’s Place in Boston is the kind of spot where tradition meets passion, tucked away in Eastie and brimming with that unassuming charm that says, “We let the food do the talking.” It’s the kind of place where you don’t need bells and whistles, just a table, a bottle of Chianti, and dishes that feel like they were made with you in mind.

The lobster ravioli, made famous on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, is everything you hope it will be. Plump, tender pasta pockets filled with sweet, fresh lobster meat, swimming in a rich tomato cream sauce that coats each bite with just the right amount of decadence. It’s the kind of dish that makes you pause, savoring every bite as if it’s your first.

The arancini arrive golden and crisp, giving way to a creamy, cheesy interior dotted with savory bits of meat. They’re the perfect starter, warm and indulgent, preparing you for the bolder flavors to come.

The Bolognese is a masterclass in simplicity—a slow-cooked meat sauce with layers of flavor that cling to perfectly al dente pasta. It’s hearty, comforting, and utterly satisfying, the kind of dish that makes you feel at home even if it’s your first visit.

A bottle of Chianti ties it all together, its dark fruit notes and earthy tannins complementing the richness of the meal while keeping things grounded.

Rino’s Place is more than a meal; it’s an experience, a glimpse into the heart of Italian cooking in Boston. From the famous ravioli to the classic Bolognese, it’s the kind of place you leave feeling full—not just in your stomach, but in your soul.
