After an overnight flight to Madrid and no hotel in sight yet, there’s no better way to ease into the city than by simply wandering its streets, absorbing its energy and charm.

First stop: Viena Capellanes, a staple in Madrid’s café scene. Here, a bite of their apple tart is like a warm hug, its flaky crust giving way to sweet, tangy apple filling, the perfect blend of indulgence and comfort. And then there’s the orange donut, a zesty twist on a classic, where the citrus notes elevate the sweetness, waking up your senses after the long journey. It’s a place that feels like a quiet refuge amidst the city’s buzz, with pastries that are more than just food—they’re little moments of joy.

As the day moves along, a stop at Bistro Urquijo offers just what you need to keep going: a café con leche. This rich, smooth coffee with its creamy milk is quintessential Madrid. Sitting at a small table, watching the world go by, it’s easy to get lost in the rhythm of the city. No rush, just letting the energy of the place wash over you.

Madrid, with its unassuming cafes and warm pastries, knows how to welcome travelers—even when the journey has only just begun.
