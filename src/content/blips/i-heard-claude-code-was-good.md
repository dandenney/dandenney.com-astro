title: I heard Claude Code was good

My first AI helper for coding was [Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview) and at first I was impressed! It helped solve some problems, but overall the experience was janky. It felt exactly like it was: a bolt-on. 

I had heard good things about [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) and DataCamp offered the option to switch to it at work. It felt (still feels) like an IDE made to work with LLMs by default. 

Recently, I've heard so much about Claude Code, but I was skeptical. I couldn't see how moving away from an IDE could be a good experience when the best experience was one built in. 

Then, I watched a video where they ran Claude Code in the terminal in Cursor and that got me to try it. Now, I have seen the power of the tool. From a code "comprehension" standpoint, it is significantly better than the models that I can access in Cursor. I'm using Claude Sonnet, but Opus and the specific programming behind Claude Code is just so good. 

One other aside, two devs I highly respect told me that they're on the $200/month model and completely happy with it. A third is on the $100/month and they're happy too.

It's a fun time to be building things on the web!
