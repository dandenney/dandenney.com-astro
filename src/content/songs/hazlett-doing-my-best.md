Listening to Hazlett’s “doing my best” feels akin to wandering through a sun-dappled forest after a storm—each note dripping with the weight of recent rain but illuminated by the promise of solace. The opening strums of the guitar unfurl like an opening flower, warming the cool air with their gentle vibrancy. It’s as if Hazlett, with his soft yet piercing vocal delivery, is inviting us into an intimate space where vulnerability feels not just permissible but necessary. The lyrics weave together a tapestry of self-reflection and quiet determination, encapsulating that universal struggle of wanting to be enough while grappling with the disquiet of self-doubt.

In a cultural landscape that often prioritizes bombast and bravado, “doing my best” stands out for its tender authenticity, reminiscent of the confessional songwriting that emerged in the folk revival of the early 2000s. Hazlett’s melodies—simple yet haunting—remind us that there is power in fragility. There’s a deeply human resonance in his words, a reminder that honesty can be both liberating and isolating. “I’m just doing my best,” he sings, a mantra that resonates through the layers of acoustic instrumentation, which rise and fall like the tides of our own emotional landscapes. As listeners, we are invited to embrace our imperfections alongside him, to find solace in the shared experience of navigating life’s complexities.

In the broader arc of Hazlett’s burgeoning career, “doing my best” encapsulates not just a moment of artistic growth but also an earnest acknowledgment of the struggles that bind us. It serves as both a mirror and a balm, reflecting our innermost desires for acceptance and understanding. This song doesn’t just exist within the indie folk genre; it elevates it, breathing life into the notion that sometimes, simply showing up—heart in hand, truth laid bare—is in itself an act of profound courage. As the final notes linger, they leave behind an echo of hope, a quiet celebration of resilience in the face of our own frailties.
