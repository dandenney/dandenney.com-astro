As "Nothing Strange" unfolds, it immediately envelops the listener in a cascade of shimmering synths and syncopated rhythms that feel both familiar and otherworldly. The song's opening pulse is like the gentle hum of a distant memory, one that emerges from the shadows of nostalgia and pokes playfully at our sense of self. It’s a track that revels in contradiction—thrumming with energy yet laced with a wistful longing. The Rabbitts weave a sonic tapestry that transports us, urging us to confront the complexities of our own emotional landscapes.

What strikes me most about this track is the way it navigates the spaces between certainty and ambiguity. The lyrics are deceptively simple yet artfully layered, a poignant exploration of the mundane moments we often overlook in our quest for meaning. In its insistence that nothing feels strange in a world that thrives on dissonance, The Rabbitts invite us to embrace the quirks of our existence, to find solace in the surreal. This song feels like a quiet reflection on intimacy and distance, a reminder of the human experiences that bind us, even when we feel fractured.

In the context of their album, *Orbital Collection*, "Nothing Strange" serves as a pivotal touchstone—an emblem of the band’s evolution from experimental soundscapes to a more coherent yet intricate identity. Here, The Rabbitts reaffirm their ability to elicit warmth in the coldest corners of the electronic genre, crafting a sound that resonates deeply with our shared human experience. The track slips effortlessly into the realm of the transcendent, asking us to confront what lies within: our desires, our fears, that undeniable ache of yearning for connection. As it fades into silence, I realize that perhaps nothing is truly strange after all; it is simply the myriad ways we seek to understand ourselves that connect us to the world.
