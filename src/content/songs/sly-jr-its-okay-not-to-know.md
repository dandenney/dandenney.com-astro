## Review

Sly Jr.’s **“It’s Okay Not To Know”** arrives as part of *Natural Habitat* (released **2026-02-13**) and makes a concise impression in its **3:19** runtime. Framed in an alternative-indie context, the track feels built for listeners who value mood and emotional positioning over over-explained statements. Its title alone sets the tone: uncertainty is not treated as failure, but as a human condition worth sitting with for a few minutes.

At this length, the song avoids overstaying its welcome. There is enough space to establish atmosphere, develop a central feeling, and leave on a lingering note without stretching the idea thin. That efficiency works in its favor. Rather than trying to force a dramatic arc, the track’s compact format suggests confidence in restraint, which often aligns well with the best alternative-indie releases.

One caveat for close textual analysis: **lyrics search attempts did not yield a reliable source** at the time of review. Because of that, this assessment avoids line-by-line interpretation and focuses on the release context, framing, and overall listening impression that can be discussed responsibly without inventing content.

Within those limits, “It’s Okay Not To Know” stands out as a thoughtful, tightly scoped entry from Sly Jr. on *Natural Habitat*—short, emotionally coherent, and conceptually clear. **Verdict: a worthwhile listen that turns ambiguity into its strongest asset.**
