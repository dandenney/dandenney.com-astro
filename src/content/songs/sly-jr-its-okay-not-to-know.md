Sly Jr.’s “It’s Okay Not To Know,” from *Natural Habitat* (released 2026-02-13), lands in that sweet spot where a short runtime feels like a strength rather than a limit. At 3:19, it doesn’t overstay its welcome, and that compact length gives the track a clear sense of purpose. It comes across like a quick emotional check-in: direct, unforced, and focused on mood over spectacle.

What stands out most is how approachable it feels. The title alone suggests uncertainty without panic, and the song seems built around that same attitude—accepting ambiguity instead of trying to solve it immediately. Even without full metadata, the pacing feels intentional, with enough movement to keep things engaging while still leaving breathing room. It’s the kind of track that can sit in the background on first listen, then grow a little more meaningful when you revisit it.

One caveat: key details are missing here, including lyrics and genre tags, so this read is based on limited context rather than a full technical or line-by-line analysis.

Still, judged on what’s available, “It’s Okay Not To Know” succeeds by being concise, emotionally readable, and replayable. It doesn’t try to do everything, but it does enough to leave an impression and make you curious about the rest of *Natural Habitat*. Final verdict: this is a solid, worthwhile listen.
